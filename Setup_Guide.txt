In order to use Simple Object-Oriented Database, move the simpleoodb.py file to the Lib folder in your Python 34 distribution.
Then use "import simpleoodb" in your python file to import it's capabilities - and that's it, have fun!


Do note: when you make a new db, the default login is user: 'root', password: 'root', database: the name of the database you just made, table: 'whatever you gave it' (change login info by making new account, then deleting root)
